        "\n",
        "1) Similarities to Diffusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Fire spreads from one cell to nearby cells, similar to how particles diffuse.\n",
        "- The slow regrowth of trees is like a gradual mixing process.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)Similarities to Percolation:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The fire’s ability to spread depends on how connected the trees are.\n",
        "- There is a threshold density; if trees are far spread from one another, fire dies out. If they are dense, fire can travel far.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Predictions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- We might see chunks of burning areas and safe zones.\n",
        "- Small changes in tree placements could cause big changes in fire spread.\n",
        "- The system may switch suddenly from low activity to large wildfires when the forest is connected enough."
